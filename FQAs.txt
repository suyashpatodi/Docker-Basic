Q- Why docker?
    A- When we deploy our application on server. Server might try to download the latest versions of packages but it is possible that our application works with certain version. 
        Or if a person wants to run the application is his system and the version pf package is not compatible with his system's version. 
        To overcome this scenario we create image of our application with certain package versions and those images are used to create container and can be used for executing. 
        The container created does not care about the version of packages in system.

Q- What are base images and why we need them?
    A- Base images are images of packages that we use to run our application.
       Like for a React js aaplication we need node. So we just pull the base image and then create image for our project. they are like pre-requisites.
       This base images can be downloaded from either docker hub or directly in docker desktop. 

Q- Why do we create versions of images rather than just creating new image?
    A- It is also an option but to keep things easier to understand we create version. By version we can just get the latest version and create container for it. 
       And we do not have to remember the names of the container.

Q- What are volumne and why we use them?
    A- Container only store temp data and any change in code is not reflected in the running contaoner. We need to create a new image and container to reflect those changes.
       To overcome this problem we use volumes. Voulmes are used for data persistence  and sharing. One volume can be shared between multiple containers.
       Data in volumes is not lost when the container stops, is removed, or is updated.
